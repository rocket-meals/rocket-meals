## IMOPRTANT!

https://github.com/rocket-meals/rocket-meals/issues/139

Currently when we want to apply a change we need to move the extension out of the directusExtensions folder and then back in to the directusExtensions folder. Then start directus, remove the not found extension, stop the server and then move the extension back in and start the server again.

## Add New Extensions To a Bundle
Create New

Navigate to your bundle extension directory in your terminal.
Use the `npm run add` command and select an extension type.

The new created extension will be added to the bundle's package.json file.

In your bundle's package.json file, the directus:extension object has an entries array that describes all of the items contained within the bundle.

## Build the Bundle

https://docs.directus.io/extensions/creating-extensions.html

Navigate to your bundle extension directory in your terminal.
Use the `npm run build` command to build the bundle.
