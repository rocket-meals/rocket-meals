### Apple Sign In

Since it is a bit ugly with apple, here is a small tutorial:

! You will need an Apple Developer Account !
Followed partially tutorial from: Found from: https://sarunw.com/posts/sign-in-with-apple-4/

- 1. Find your Apple Team ID --> Variable TEAM_ID
  - https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list
  - Top right corner, after your name like: "... - 6U99XXXXXX"
- 2. Create a new App ID
  - Visit Identifiers (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
  - Press on the "+" Button
  - Select "App IDs"
  - Fill in a name and a Bundle ID
    - Bundle ID: "de.<PRODUCT>.sso"
    - Description: "SSO"
  - Activate "Sign in with Apple"
  - Save and Register
  - Click on "Configure" (Sign in with Apple)
    - Select the primary App ID
    - Save and Continue
    - Register
- 3. Create a Service ID (Configuration of the Return URL)
  - Visit Identifiers (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
  - Press top right on the search icon and search for "Service IDs"
  - Select one or create a new "Register an Service ID"
  - Select "Service IDs" and press the "Continue" Button
  - Fill in the following:
    - Description: "<PRODUCT> SSO Service"
    - Identifier: "de.<PRODUCT>.service.sso"
  - The identifier of the service will be our "AUTH_APPLE_CLIENT_ID"
  - Check "Sign in with Apple"
  - Click "Configure" (Sign in with Apple)
    - Select or create a primary App ID
    - Enter Domains: "<PUBLIC_URL>"
      - Replace <PUBLIC_URL> with your instance of your server
      - Eg. "XXX.rocket-meals.de"
    - Enter the return URLs: "https://<PUBLIC_URL>/rocket-meals/api/auth/login/apple/callback"
      - Replace <PUBLIC_URL> with your instance of your server
      - eg. "https://XXX.rocket-meals.de/rocket-meals/api/auth/login/apple/callback"
      - Continue --> Save
- Keys (https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list)
  - Create a new key
  - Fill in a name: "SSO Key"
  - Check "Sign in with Apple"
  - Click Configure (Sign in with Apple)
    - Select same primary App ID as before
  - Click Continue
  - Click Register
  - Save "Key ID", we will need this in a moment
  - Save File as we cannot download it again
    - Save it in Google Drive
    - The content of the file will be our "KEY_FILE_CONTENT"
    - Otherwise you can use the file itself too
  - Click Download and save file as: "key.txt"
- Secret Generation
  - Have the following values ready: "TEAM_ID", "AUTH_APPLE_CLIENT_ID", "KEY_ID", "KEY_FILE_CONTENT"
  - run `./genSSO_Apple.sh --team_id <TEAM_ID> --client_id <AUTH_APPLE_CLIENT_ID> --key_id <KEY_ID> --key_file_content "<>"`
    - Alternatively you can use the file path instead of the content with `--key_file_path <PATH_TO_FILE>`
  - Copy the output --> This will be our AUTH_APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET
- Adapt docker-compose.yaml
  - Add `apple` to auth providers in the following `AUTH_PROVIDERS: "apple,google,facebook"` or only apple (line 89) ! Apple needs to be first due to terms & conditions

## Troubleshooting

- URL: XXX.rocket-meals.de
  - Message: "Invalid redirect URL"
  - Altough the message states that the redirect URL is invalid, the problem is the secret
  - Check the server log:
  - ```
    err: {
      "type": "",
      "message": "Service \"openid\" is unavailable. Service returned unexpected response: undefined.",
      "stack":
          DirectusError: Service "openid" is unavailable. Service returned unexpected response: undefined.

      "name": "DirectusError",
      "extensions": {

      },
      "code": "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE",
      "status": 503
    }
    ```
  - This means apple allows the redirect to rocket-meals but rocket-meals may have a problem with the secret.
  - Check if the secret is correct
  - The server log throws an error about "Open ID", which means the secret provided is not correct
- URL: apple.com
  - Message "redirect_uri_mismatch"
  - Apple does not allow the redirect to the URL
      - Check if the redirect URL is correct. Check if it contains "/rocket-meals/api" and not only "/api"
